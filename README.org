PLOKAMI is a lispy interface to libpcap built on top of a CFFI portability
layer. Complete bindings to every function in libpcap are in pcap.lisp
and a higher level interface in plokami.lisp.

* Features
  - Realtime network packet capture
  - Injection
  - PCAP dumpfile read/write
  - BPF
  - Timeouts and operation in non-blocking mode
  - Full support for Windows through WinPCAP

The library has been tested on SBCL (linux/darwin), ClozureCL and 
LispWorks (darwin/win32) but should work on every platform that 
CFFI supports.

* Performance
Minimal/non-existent overhead over plain libpcap. Low memory
use with very few dynamic allocations. No GC delays/packet loss due to
garbage collection.

* License
The code comes with a BSD-style license so you can basically do with it
whatever you want.
